== LocalStack

The plugin provides a set of tasks for easily starting and stopping the LocalStack environment in your project.

=== Tasks

The plugin applies default tasks, which can be executed from the Gradle command line:

[options="header"]
[cols="5,3,10,10"]
|=======
|Task Name          |Type | Usage | Description
|`initLocalStack`   | Default | `./gradlew initLocalStack`  |Initializes the project with a default LocalStack Docker Compose configuration.
|`startLocalStack`  | Default | `./gradlew startLocalStack` |Starts the LocalStack environment and executes any of the AWS services tasks that are found in the project.
|`stopLocalStack`   | Default | `./gradlew stopLocalStack` |Stops the LocalStack environment and preserves the `.localstack` data directory.
|`killLocalStack`   | Default | `./gradlew killLocalStack` |Stops the LocalStack environment and deletes the `.localstack` data directory.
|`cleanLocalStack`  | Default | `./gradlew cleanLocalStack` |Deletes the `.localstack` data directory.

The plugin also provides tasks that make working with the mock AWS endpoints in LocalStack easy. Currently, the plugin
supports the following AWS services:

1. <<30-aws-cloudformation.adoc#cloudformation,CloudFormation>>
2. <<40-aws-dynamodb.adoc#dynamodb,DynamoDB>>
3. <<50-aws-s3.adoc#s3,S3>>
4. <<60-aws-sqs.adoc#s3,SQS>>

For more information on how to configure and use these tasks, see the documentation for each AWS service below.
