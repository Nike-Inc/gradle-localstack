== Spring Boot
This plugin is designed to work seamlessly with Spring Boot. When the Spring Boot plugin is detected within the project
this plugin will automatically add tasks that make developing and debugging your Spring Boot application within LocalStack
seamless.

=== Tasks

The plugin applies default tasks, which can be executed from the Gradle command line:

[options="header"]
[cols="5,3,10,10"]
|=======
|Task Name              |Type      | Usage                         | Description
|`bootRunLocal`         | Default | `./gradlew bootRunLocal`      | Starts LocalStack, configures the defined LocalStack environment, and then starts the Spring Boot application.
|`bootRunLocalDebug`    | Default | `./gradlew bootRunLocalDebug` | Starts LocalStack, configures the defined LocalStack environment, and then starts the Spring Boot application in remote debug mode (waits for a debugger to be attached).
|=======

=== Configuration

[options="header"]
